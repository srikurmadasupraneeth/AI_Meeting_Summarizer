# ü§ñ AI Meeting Summarizer

This is a full-stack web application that leverages a large language model to summarize meeting transcripts and share the results via email. It's built with a simple, functional design, focusing on core features: summarizing, editing, and sharing.

## ‚ú® Features

  - **Summarize Transcripts**: Upload a `.txt` file or paste raw text from meeting notes or call transcripts.
  - **Custom AI Instructions**: Guide the AI's output with a custom prompt, such as "Highlight action items" or "Summarize for executives in bullet points."
  - **Editable Summaries**: The generated summary is fully editable.
  - **Email Sharing**: Send the final, edited summary to one or more recipients directly from the application.
  - **Flexible AI Backend**: Easily switch between **Groq** (default) and **OpenAI** by changing an environment variable.
  - **Markdown Rendering**: The AI-generated summaries are automatically formatted with headings, lists, and bold text for easy readability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

### **Backend**

  - **Node.js**: The runtime environment for the server.
  - **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework used to build the REST API.
  - **Groq SDK** or **Node-fetch**: For making API calls to the chosen LLM.
  - **Nodemailer**: Handles sending emails via an SMTP service.
  - **dotenv**: Manages environment variables for secure API keys and credentials.
  - **marked**: A Markdown parser to convert the AI's response into HTML.

### **Frontend**

  - **HTML5 & CSS3**: The basic structure and styling of the user interface.
  - **Bootstrap 5**: Provides a clean, responsive, and functional layout without extensive custom CSS.
  - **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Handles all client-side logic, including API calls and DOM manipulation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

  - **Node.js**: Ensure you have a recent version installed (Node.js 18 or higher is recommended).
  - **API Key**: You'll need an API key from either [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
  - **SMTP Credentials**: To enable the email feature, you'll need SMTP credentials from a provider like Brevo (Sendinblue), Gmail, Mailgun, etc.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-meeting-summarizer.git
    cd ai-meeting-summarizer
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory.

    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

2.  **Add the following variables** to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

    ```
    # To use Groq (Recommended for speed)
    USE_GROQ=1
    GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
    GROQ_MODEL="llama3-8b-8192"

    # To use OpenAI instead, comment out the Groq variables above and uncomment these
    # USE_GROQ=0
    # OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    # OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"

    # SMTP Credentials for Email Sharing
    # Example using Brevo (Sendinblue)
    SMTP_HOST="smtp-relay.brevo.com"
    SMTP_PORT=587
    SMTP_USER="your-brevo-username"
    SMTP_PASS="your-brevo-api-key"
    SMTP_FROM="your-verified-sender-email@example.com"
    ```

### Running the Application

  - **Development Mode**: Uses `nodemon` to automatically restart the server on file changes.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

  - **Production Mode**: Starts the server normally.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
